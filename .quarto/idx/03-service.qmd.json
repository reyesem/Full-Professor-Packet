Buehner, often misattributed to Maya Angelou](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/04/06/they-feel/?amp=1)\n\n\nLike many other new faculty, my service was initially defined by others; I served on the committees to which I was assigned, and I volunteered in my department when asked.  I have come to believe that this view of \"service\" --- an obligation to be fulfilled --- leads only to faculty burn-out.  When we serve in ways that make use of our particular gifts, we are more likely to find the role fulfilling, and it is ultimately more beneficial to the Institute.  This does not mean that I never experience frustration in my service roles, and there will always be jobs that need to be done; just as there are bad days in the classroom, service can be draining.  However, as I have learned to say \"yes\" to opportunities that complement my skillset, I have found service to be less burdensome and more rewarding.\n\nI think my involvement with the Rose Show best encapsulates my perspective on service.  Ashley Bernal is passionate about providing a space for students from all disciplines to showcase their work.  She is the heart of the event.  As a part of the planning committee for the Rose Show, my focus has been streamlining some administrative tasks so that Ashley can focus on the layout and the overall vision for the event.  I moved the registration process to Moodle so we could capture information about each team automatically and all members of the planning team had access to the information; the electronic registration also allows us to automate the construction of the physical and [online programs](https://reyesem.github.io/roseshow).  When Ashley had a vision for the [Innovation Award](https://reyesem.github.io/innovation-award), I worked to put a system in place to collect video submissions from participants wishing to be considered.  At each step, my goal has been to support Ashley's vision for the event while operating out of my strengths.\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## My Professional Mission as a Servant\nTo _serve_ in roles where my administrative skills support the work of others.\n:::\n\nMy time on the Faculty Affairs Committee was interesting to say the least.  During the Fall of my first year, the Board removed the President.  Following the news, the faculty called a special meeting to discuss whether the board should forgo a national search in favor of appointing Rob Coons as president.  Following the meeting, the chair of the Faculty Affairs Committee (Rebecca Dyer) and the Faculty Representative to the Board (Christine Buckley) met to draft a letter to the Board summarizing the faculty perspective.  As I had volunteered to take notes during the meeting, I was present as they drafted the letter.  I watched as these colleagues managed to succinctly summarize the varied thoughts of the faculty in a powerful endorsement to the board.  I am proud to have played a small role in that letter, and I am fortunate to have seen a wonderful example of their setting aside personal opinions in service to their role as a representative of the broader faculty.  As a member of Faculty Affairs, my primary contribution that year was taking point on drafting language for the Faculty Handbook to revise our policy on timing for tenure following family and medical leaves.  The revisions were not mine; my role was to create language that both reflected the thoughts of faculty who saw the need for change and could be operationalized by the Department Heads who act as the first point of contact in these cases.  I synthesized the ideas of others for the benefit of the larger community.  I would learn this lesson again at the end of the year as we saw another administrative transition.  Serving on the search committee for the Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs, our task was not to provide our opinions on the next Provost but to summarize the qualifications of the candidates and the thoughts of the faculty to aid in the President's decision.\n\nBelieving that first year would be difficult to top, I served as chair of Faculty Affairs during the Winter and Spring terms of the 2019-2020 academic year.  The examples I had seen of acting as a representative in that first year would prove to be useful as the Institute shifted to accommodate the COVID pandemic.  The spring saw a shift to remote learning, and with that came apprehension about student well-being in the midst of both the pandemic and a new paradigm for learning.  As a committee, our greatest accomplishment was passing a measure to allow students to take courses as pass/fail during the Spring term.  It is rare to see such agreement in the faculty, and I can take no credit.  My job was to steward the wonderful team we had and the ideas they generated.  They put forward several options, and we needed to find new ways to disseminate those options and gather faculty input.  We built a Teams site for the committee and developed a Moodle page for disseminating information to all faculty (both of which are still used today).  \n\nMy third year on Faculty Affairs, I served as co-chair.  People mistakenly believe chairing during the Spring of 2020 was difficult, but I maintain that Simon Jones had a more difficult job chairing during the 2020-2021 academic year.  The unity we felt during the Spring of 2020 was much more tenuous during the following year.  As the pandemic became more endemic, the variability in faculty opinions grew.  Simon did a phenomenal job of leading us through that year.  What I could offer was support.  Amidst the discussions on our pandemic response, Simon and I were charged with drafting language for a \"Professor of Practice\" position to support a group of colleagues who did not fit into the traditional tenure-track line.  In drafting this language, we did not start from scratch; we synthesized what we saw at other universities in a way that addressed the needs of our Institute.  While I was not a part of Faculty Affairs the following year, I hope the document we produced was helpful to those who crafted what eventually became the \"Reoccurring Appointment.\"  \n\nI have recently completed a term as the Faculty Representative to the Board of Trustees.  The Faculty Handbook says almost nothing about this role, and that lack of clarity led to a lot of misunderstanding among faculty, the President, and the Board.  Building on work started the previous year (when Adam Nolte was the Faculty Representative), Ashley Bernal, Scott Tieken, and I worked with President Coons to draft a document that operationalized the description in the Faculty Handbook.  It provides clarity on the actual duties of the representatives in communicating with the President and the Board of Trustees and sets out agreed upon timelines for conducting the annual climate survey.  The annual survey was both the part where I felt most at ease and the most emotionally draining.  While we perceive student comments to be brutal, faculty comments can be demoralizing.  What I enjoyed was not reading through the comments but finding ways to condense them down to meaningful feedback for the Cabinet and the Board.  Like Faculty Affairs, my time in this position provided an entirely different perspective on the Institute.  It was a joy to stand before the board and showcase the hidden stories of what faculty do on a regular basis to make Rose a success.  At the same time, balancing those stories to the Board while simultaneously clearly expressing concerns felt by faculty to the Cabinet was extremely challenging.  I still worry about whether my responses to the Board clearly communicated the broader faculty sentiment.\n\nWhile I leveraged my gifts in choosing how to serve on Faculty Affairs and as the Faculty Representative, both positions were elected.  Where I have had more freedom in designing my service on campus has been through assessment.  Since the Fall of 2019, I have been our departmental representative to the Committee for the Assessment of Student Outcomes.  When I joined, the committee was in the midst of crafting the rubrics for the [Institute Student Learning Outcomes](https://rosehulman-my.sharepoint.com/personal/trachten_rose-hulman_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Ftrachten_rose-hulman_edu%2FDocuments%2FShared%20with%20everyone%2FResources%20for%20faculty%20and%20staff%2FInstitute%20Student%20Learning%20Outcomes%2F2020-21%20CASO%20Rubrics%2Epdf&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Ftrachten_rose-hulman_edu%2FDocuments%2FShared%20with%20everyone%2FResources%20for%20faculty%20and%20staff%2FInstitute%20Student%20Learning%20Outcomes&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9yb3NlaHVsbWFuLW15LnNoYXJlcG9pbnQuY29tLzpiOi9nL3BlcnNvbmFsL3RyYWNodGVuX3Jvc2UtaHVsbWFuX2VkdS9FY3lqN19yREVQaEhuakFoR0ZyZ0Z2SUJpRmpyT0dmVmxIUTZfaC1NbGVJRXdRP3J0aW1lPWE1MmpfTy1VMlVn).  I quickly learned that assessment offers an opportunity to ask the \"big questions\" that I enjoy discussing (like what does it mean to \"collaborate\"; and, do we teach critical thinking or do we teach discipline skills and expect critical thinking to develop as a by-product).  As the representative to CASO, it was natural for me to serve on our departmental committee (with Kenji Kozai, Manda Riehl, Josh Holden, and Bill Butske) in drafting program learning outcomes for Mathematics.  As our program is not accredited by an external agency (like ABET), our department did not have an assessment plan in place.  Once the department had approved an assessment plan, I agreed to chair the [Mathematics Assessment Group for Program Improvement](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/course/view.php?id=83104), our department's committee for overseeing program assessment.  My administrative skills helped to create a repository for our process, including the collection of artifacts, but the real work has been (alongside team members David Finn and Rachel Petrik) synthesizing the many varied opinions within our department to create actionable steps to improve the assessment of the program.\n\nOne area where we could improve as a faculty body, myself included, is transition.  We serve in positions and then move on, often leaving the individuals who rotate into those positions no direction.  In many instances, the Faculty Handbook provides little guidance on navigating a specific role.  I am concerned this exacerbates faculty burn-out; it might signal the role, or the individual, has such little importance that we are unwilling to provide adequate support.  Despite recognizing this, I have been slow to improve how I handle transitions.  As the outgoing chair of Faculty Affairs, I created a transition document for the next chair, outlining key dates to keep in mind, initiatives we had not yet completed, and notes about some of the unanticipated responsibilities.  A similar document for the Faculty Representative to the Board position described my thoughts on the position and navigating the vague nature of the position.  Helping one another enter a position should be a part of our service, as should knowing when to step aside.  \n\nIn deciding whether to seek a promotion, I surveyed colleagues on my strengths and areas of needed improvement.  The most common advice I received was that I am over-extended.  Of course, that could be the polite way of conveying the other concern that was communicated to me through other channels: I have an ego.  If we believe we are the only one who has a solution, we are bound to seek the spotlight; I am still learning how to step aside.  Within our department, my primary area of service for a number of years involved the registration system for the High School Math Contest.  I jumped into that position because I saw the burden it was taking on our administrative assistant at the time, and I thought there had to be an easier way.  I did what I could to streamline the process by using an online tool for collecting registrations electronically and writing a program to process changes to the registration quickly so that we could create answer sheets for participants the morning of the competition.  My stepping out of that role allowed someone else (Kyle Claassen) to elevate that platform to a level that I could not have accomplished.  I needed to let go so that someone else could use their skills to their fullest potential; I could stand to do that more often.\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Operating in Places that Complement My Interests and Gifts\nI am learning to align my service with my interests and gifts, which requires me to remind myself regularly that I am not the best person for every job.  I define success not by whether someone is aware of my actions, but whether those I served, or served alongside, experienced a moment of calm because their burden was a little lighter.\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"center","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["mystyles.css"],"output-file":"03-service.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
