{"title":"Note to the Reader","markdown":{"headingText":"Note to the Reader","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n> Certain authors, speaking of their works, say \"My book,\" \"My commentary,\" \"My history,\" etc....They would do better to say \"Our book,\" \"Our commentary,\" \"Our history,\" etc., because there is in them usually more of other people's than their own.[^Pensees43]\n\n[^Pensees43]: [Pascal, Blaise. _Pascal's Pen√©es_. (1958) New York:EP Dutton, (#43)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_43)\n\nAt the peak of summer, as a heat wave enveloped the country, the horn blast signaled the start of the Mac --- the longest annual freshwater sailing race in the world where hundreds of sailors gather to race across Lake Michigan and Lake Huron from Chicago to Mackinac Island.  Wanting to witness the magic, we maneuvered the boat to the outside of the fleet and watched as teams capitalized on the southerly winds, dotting the horizon with spinnakers[^spinnaker].  In that moment, as I stood at the helm, the boat and wind gently rocking our ship, I was at peace knowing there was no where else I wanted to be.\n\n[^spinnaker]: a large sail that acts as a kite, allowing the wind to push the boat downwind ([seen here in an image from the 2024 race start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NrW5GJNlNJxoZi73NggF7sHlc6oJlpdx/view?usp=sharing)).\n\nWhile I have no aspirations of ever competing in the Mac, I have enjoyed learning to sail over the past several years.  Each summer day on the water harnessing the wind (with no particular destination in mind) soothes the wounds of a hard academic year. And, each outing provides a learning opportunity --- a chance for my boat to teach me a bit more about being a sailor.  Early this summer, my youngest daughter asked if I would take her out, \"just the two of us,\" for the afternoon and teach her more about sailing.  Including her in the preparations, she tied knots and steered our course as I raised the sails.  Just as we got underway, the wind caught my hat and sent it flying into the lake.  The outing was now a lesson in conducting a crew-over-board maneuver (it was a nice hat).  The standard maneuver required that we sail away from the hat, turn through the wind, and then approach the hat from downwind so that we could easily control our speed --- me steering a steady course allowing my daughter to reach overboard and retrieve the hat.  \n\nTo an onlooker only familiar with powered vessels, my actions would seem strange.  Instead of turning immediately to recover the hat, we chose to first sail farther away.  An abrupt turn easily executed on a powered vessel could result in the sailboat capsizing.  In that moment, success required that I employ my knowledge and skills not only to achieving my personal desires (I wanted that hat back) but also to safeguarding the well-being of the vessel and its crew.  I believe the same should be true within academia.  The success/strength of a portfolio should not be determined solely by the line items on a faculty member's CV; we should also consider how the faculty member has stewarded the mission of the Institute to its benefit, including its faculty and students.\n\nThis portfolio reflects on the decisions I have made in charting the course of my career.  While I am uncertain of my destination, I can describe my current direction and the principles that guide that direction.  As such, this portfolio is organized around the facets of my professional mission and vision, developed alongside a group of colleagues[^PPP], that guide my professional activities.  I routinely tell my students they should never trust a study that omits a \"limitations\" section; as such, this portfolio reflects on both my positive intent and areas of concern.  I then submit to your determination whether my path is of benefit to the Institute.\n\n[^PPP]: During the 2021-2022 academic year, supported by the Center for the Practice of Scholarship and Education, I facilitated a reading of Susan Robison's [_The Peak Performing Professor: A Practical Guide to Productivity and Happiness_](http://peakperformingprofessor.com/ppp/) with five colleagues.  I owe a great deal to the conversations with these amazing women: Eva Andrijcic, Sylvia Carlisle, Heather Chenette, Michelle Marincel Payne, and Jenny Mueller.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nThis portfolio was designed to be read online ([click here](https://reyesem.github.io/full-professor-packet/)).
