# What's In a Name?

[^Incredibles]: Holly Hunter as Helen Parr (Elastigirl) in _The Incredibles_.

While I have not had the responsibility of reviewing portfolios requesting a promotion to Full Professor, I anticipate that my portfolio may have had a different tone and emphasis than others, particularly those from the Department of Mathematics.  The achievements of my departmental colleagues speak volumes about their commitment to their respective specialties within Mathematics.  My advanced degrees are in Statistics; I teach Statistics courses, apply statistical methods to advance the research of others, collaborate and serve within the Statistics Education community, and I am a member of the American Statistical Association.  I am a Statistician who is housed in the Department of Mathematics.[^statvmath]  I note the distinction because it so often impacts my perspectives on academic life, and by extension, the nature of this portfolio.

Every member of the faculty contributes a unique perspective and skillset to the Institute.  This portfolio was my honest reflection on how I fit within that larger body, including the strengths and weaknesses I contribute.  I will probably always fall short of the professor I envision I should be, but I hope my path will continue to serve the Institute well.

I appreciate your consideration of this portfolio. 


[^statvmath]: While not universally settled, the majority of statisticians view Statistics as a discipline that, while relying heavily on Mathematics, is distinct from Mathematics.  As examples, the [article by Tran and Lee](https://fi-courses.s3.amazonaws.com/tsdi/unit_2/Essentials/Statvsmath.pdf) and the [article by Moore and Cobb](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~dsmoore/articles/Statmath.pdf) illustrate the differences.
